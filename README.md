## Summary
ake provides simple health logging, tracking, and filtering for the modern migraine patient.

## Motivation
ake fills the need for a migraine logging and tracking app that is intuitive to use, even in the midst of a migraine episode. The app's design uses ample white space to aid and ease navigation for those who are headache prone. V1 of ake includes a baseline set of fields to log on a daily basis, along with basic filtering features.

## Features
### Migraine log
Users can create logs to track each day's migraine episodes, as well as external factors such as weather, skipped meals, and water intake. Once created, logs can always be viewed, edited, or delete.

### Filtering logs
On the All Logs page, users can filter all past logs for easier migraine cause/effect tracking. Filter logs from within a certain time frame, from days when you slept outside your usual hours, or by any other log field.
